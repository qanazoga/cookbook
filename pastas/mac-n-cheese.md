makes 2 servings

Ingredients:
- 1 cup macaroni (smaller noodles are better).
- 3 cups water (this was a bit too much tbh, the objective is to use as little water as you can).
- 2 tablespoons of butter. I don't fuck around.
- 1/4 cup of cheese, you really don't need a lot, most of the taste actually comes from the butter.
- a lot of salt, and some pepper.

How-To:
1. Boil water, add some salt once it's boiling.
2. Throw in your noods, stir them around and such so they don't stick.
3. Once the noods are ready, drain as little water as you can, but try to have at least a 1/8 to 1/4 cup (starchy water is your friend).
4. Throw in all the butter, stir it real good, you need the water and butter to mix right, and the noods to be all up in it.
5. season w/ the salt and pepper before u add the cheese, leave it w/ a *teensy* bit less salt than you want.
6. add the cheese on top and don't mix it until it's eating time like they do at noods and co.
