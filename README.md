# Paige's Cookbook

### A few quick notes:
- For the most part, I don't measure my spices, everything is done to taste.

- I make changes to these recipes all the time while cooking, and mostly use 
this as a siple guide to point me in the right direction. I encourage you to
do the same.

- I hate recipe guides that give you a life story before getting to the 
ingredients.  
You will not find that here.

- Recipes are listed that I haven't written yet so that I remember to add them later.
